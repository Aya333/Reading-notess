## My summary of the reading of this class.
# The Image part:
Images are very important to use in our web pages to indicate so many things also using and designing the right images gives a beautiful and organized overview of your website which attracts the users furthermore.

#### syntax of images:

The img tag is used to define images you would want to add to your website and it is a self closing tag plus it has its own attribute.

1-**SRC**: In which we use our put the url of our image inside of it.

2-**ALT**: You use it to give an very short name that specifies the image so that if the website crashes for some reason and it's not displayed then users would know what the image is about.

3-**Title**: In which through you can define the image further so that it helps your website appearing in search engines.

4-**Height**: To control and specify the height of the image.

5-**Width**: To control and specify the width of the image.

## Tips on how you can place images in your website:

* Before paragraphs.
* Inside the start of a paragraph.
* In the middle of the paragraph.
## And with the help of ***Align*** attribute you can control how text is wrapped around the image to make the display more appealing to the eye.

# Coloring part:
Obviously coloring is one of the most important aspects that you must pay a great attention to it when designing your website and CSS provides you with a wide range of colors in which you can color backgrounds, texts and border/etc.

#### You can specify colors in three ways:

1- RGB values: This is a well known method that revolves around the three main colors (Red, Green, Blue)
and it determines the amount used of  each of the three colors in affecting  the overall color.

2- Hex code: Which uses hexa decimal numbers to define numbers and its my personal favorite method.
   

 3- Color name: You just type the name of the color you want to use.

## CSS also added another way which is the HSL & HSLA, also it is very important to note that you use contrast method to further define your color.

# Text: 
Texts are the main part of the website as everything is built based on them also text display on the website is so important to design and format. 
And text just like any element has it's own attributes that we use to format a beautiful text for our websites

Text attributes:

1- Font style family.

2- Font size.

3- Font weight.

4- Spacing.

Texts font family are very limited in terms which ones to use that are already in the text editor and i believe text editors provide you wih the ability to download font families you'd like to use.

You can align texts (left, right and center) and control spaces of texts.
