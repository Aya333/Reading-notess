#A quick recap:

## Chapter 1 recap:

We have learned in this chapter that HTML is not a programming language but a mark up language, which basically edit's text files to transform them into webpages. It also consistes of tags reffered to as elements, they come in pairs starting and closing tags also contains attributes which requires a name and value, and they are used to define the tags further.

## Chapter 8 recap:
What I have learned reading chapter 8 is that HTML had been developed so many times throughout the years and into many versions, therefore every new version was an improvement of the previous one so when you are using HTML you must make sure that your browser is compatible with the version you are using.
For example, **HTML4** was released in **1997** and there was a tag called “strike” that would cross the word but that tag is not used anymore in HTML5.
Later on, **XML** was released in **1998** it was a made to become the newest markup language and takeover HTML, but upon this release HTML4 was re formulated into **HTML5** which was released in **2000**.
Also a few important tags.

## Chapter 17 recap:
 Titled (HTML5 layout) so this chapter talks about the long running style of designing HTML pages which is what you would normally see in blogging websites, and then the second page is talking about how almost it’s the same style but with improved new elements. Such improvements and some of the new elements were made to organize your own code and they are the following:
 1-Headers & footers.
 2-Navigation.
 3-Article.
 4-Aside.
 5-Sections.
 6-Heading groups.
And a lot more

## Chapter 18 recap:
What I have learned reading chapter 18 called process & design is that there are a few things you need to take in consideration before starting the work on your web site.
So first of all, when talking to your client the very first thing you need to know is **who the targeted audience is?** Because that’s who you will be designing and building the website for that should be your main focus.
The book suggests a few questions to help you understand further (read the book it’s helpful) it also mentions a great method you can follow which is by creating fictional visitors for your website where you can test different thongs on.
Second thing to consider after knowing which groups of people you are targeting is **why they would choose to visit your website out of all others?** And for this the book suggests two main key points that would help:
1-Visitors motivation.
2-Visitors goals.

# JavaScript & jQuery book:
## Introduction:
## In general, this book is all about how to make your website more dynamic and usable beyond structuring and designs 
So, the book starts by implying the three main pre-requisite’s you need to start coding in JavaScript:
1.Understanding basic syntax and rules of the language.
2.Having a passion to learn the language itself.
3.Familiarize yourself of the its application by practicing what you have learned.
## How does JavaScript make the website more interactive? 
1.Simply by accessing and modifying its content where you can apply, add or even remove whatever parts you want.
2.It set’s a group of steps for the browser to follow so it can keep up with changes happening and users’ interactions.
3.It reacts to events happening such as a button press, clicking on a link, redirecting users to another pages, etc.
## And one last tip is checking your browsers version as some of the tags may not run because versions are not compatible with one another.
## What is a script & how do they work?
Script is a set of steps the browser must follow in order to perform a specific task and in the book the author referred to it as a “Food recipe” because them both are about the same concept, -a set of steps that you follow to create something-, it’s follows instructions step by step and the browser changes between and choosing different parts to follow depending on the orders of how users interact with it and a single script can sun many other subsets of scripts inside of it.

## Chapter 1(A,B &C):
## What is a script & how do they work?
Script is a set of steps the browser must follow in order to perform a specific task and in the book the author referred to it as a “Food recipe” because them both are about the same concept, -a set of steps that you follow to create something-, it’s follows instructions step by step and the browser changes between and choosing different parts to follow depending on the orders of how users interact with it and a single script can sun many other subsets of scripts inside of it.
## How to write a script?
In order to write a script, you should try sketching up a plan that would help you out through the process. Start by defining your main goal then find out which other necessary tasks will help you achieving it.
1.Defining goal: Ask yourself what are you trying to achieve? What’s the purpose of your script?
2.Design the script: First split the big goal into smaller chunks and then start gathering information’s and know which tasks will help you.
3.Write it using JavaScript.
An example from the book on sketching up your script plan:


## Expressions and operations:
For expressions we have two types of them:
*Assignment value expressions: which gives the variable a value to function.
*Return value expressions: Which takes two or more values to return a single one.
For operators:
*Assignment operators: Which is as mentioned used to assign a value to the variable.
*Arithmetic operators: Used for math related operations.
*String operators: Used to manipulate strings.
*Comparison operator: To compare two values and provide a result.
*Logical operator: Performs logical non mathematical operations.
### Note: Expressions depend on operators to perform tasks.
## Functions are basically very helpful because instead of writing one big code that would have some repetitive lines and operations you can simply use functions to group specific related statements that together would perform a task.
Functions syntax:
Function name of function (Parameters) {all statements necessary to execute the task}.
Helpful? Well yes because every time you want to use it all you have to do is literally call its name.


### Note: This is just a summary for more details I’d suggest you either research or read the book.
