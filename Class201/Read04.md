## My summary of the reading of this class.
# The HTML part:
Reading this part about HTML **link's** i have learned that we need link's in our website's in order to  move around between webpages, parts of our page, from one website to another, open links in new tab and even in new windows.

#### Types and suntax of links:

1-**Linking my website to other websites**: Basically we use this one in order to go from my current website/page to another website/page by pressing on the word we have linked, this can be useful in many ways but on a personal level its useful when linking your social medias aand important accounts of yours.

Syntax: <'a href = "LINK"'> <'/a'>.

2-**Linking other pages on the same site**: Used When you are linking to other pages within the same site.

Syntax: it has the same syntax as in the previous point[1], except that in the "href you don't need a URL just type in the name/path of the page".

3-**Linking emails**: Which are  basically about linking a specific email address so that once you click on it would take you to another page with an email structure that contains the email address of that person and all you have to do s write your email and send it.

Syntax: Same syntax as the previous points with an exceptio in "href= you use the word mail to: email address".

4-**Opening link in a new window**: Which is  basically the sort of link that once you click on it it opens a whole new window for that page.

Syntax: all you have to do is use the 'Target' function after the link. "Target = _blank".

5-**Linking to another part on the same page**: Which is basically you link like a paragraph or a specific title on your page so that once you press on it it will take you to where the linked part is.

Syntax: all you have to do is simply you give the specified part an id and then call that id name using the id selector in the link part inside of the anchor specified in the previous points.

6-**Linking to another part on another page**: Which is basically you link like a paragraph or a specific title on your page to another part on another page or whole other website that once you press on it it will take you to where the linked part is.

Syntax: The exact same syntax as the previous [5] point just make sure thhw parts you want to link have ID'S.
## That was it for the Links.

# CSS part:
In this part we will be talking about the layout of the page and how to appropriately organize the "Containers" of my page in order to make it presentable and easier to control.

#### Display of layouts:

1- Normal flow (static positioning): Whitch is the default position in CSS and basically its layout is about having each element on top of the other i'd like to think of as the layout of a normal book page.

2- Relative positioning: Which basically has the elements in boxes with almost the same layout as the "Normal flow" but the difference here is thatwe can control each box on it's own and move them around but it affects the postioninhg of other boxes around it.
   

 3- Absolute positioning: Once you use it the box is completely out of the normal flow and it would be on its own (meaning whatever changes will be made on the element i this positioning will not apply to others in other postionings) also the page scrolls up & down with the movements of the bars.

 4- Fixed postioning: It's a type of the absolute postioning and it does the exact oopsite, meaning it has a value of fixed which basically you scroll up & down but it stays on the same position of the page.

 5- Z-index: Used to control elements when using absolute and fixed positions to control elements so that whenever the user scrolls the page each element stays in its place.

 6- Float: Allows you to put elements on specific parts of the page without affecting the main parts. 

7- Clear float: Decides where each element will appear and how and it has attributes (left, right, both, none).
***Layouts have two types:***

- Fixed layout: It has a fixed width of elements so whether the user zooms in or out it doesnt change its width.

- Liquid layout: It changes its sizes based on users activities.

## Important to note is that there is a alayout type called grid which is cosidered to be the best and most used layout due to it's flexibility.

# JavaScript part: 
I have talked about functions in my past readings therefore i will be doing a quick recap here:

Functions are a block of code that allows you to write the code once then run it whenever and as many times as you want, it's useful to minimize code repetions, all i have to do to execute it is just invoke it.

## Now let's talk about pair programming:
It contains two roles the " Driver & Navigator ", as the driver is the one writting the code and tha navigator is the brains who guides the user through the problem without giving the solution directly, they just provide and project the idea.

Reasons to use pair programming:

1- Greater efficiency.

2- Engaged collaboration.

3- Learning from fellow students.

4- Social skills.

5- Job interview readiness.

6- Work environment readiness.

# And that was it for this summary
