## My summary of the reading of this class.
# The HTML part:
Reading this part about HTML **link's** i have learned that we need link's in our website's in order to  move around between webpages, parts of our page, from one website to another, open links in new tab and even in new windows.

#### Types and suntax of links:

1-**Linking my website to other websites**: Basically we use this one in order to go from my current website/page to another website/page by pressing on the word we have linked, this can be useful in many ways but on a personal level its useful when linking your social medias aand important accounts of yours.

Syntax: <'a href = "LINK"'> <'/a'>.

2-**Linking other pages on the same site**: Used When you are linking to other pages within the same site.

Syntax: it has the same syntax as in the previous point[1], except that in the "href you don't need a URL just type in the name/path of the page".

3-**Linking emails**: Which are  basically about linking a specific email address so that once you click on it would take you to another page with an email structure that contains the email address of that person and all you have to do s write your email and send it.

Syntax: Same syntax as the previous points with an exceptio in "href= you use the word mail to: email address".

4-**Opening link in a new window**: Which is  basically the sort of link that once you click on it it opens a whole new window for that page.

Syntax: all you have to do is use the 'Target' function after the link. "Target = _blank".

5-**Linking to another part on the same page**: Which is  basically you link like a paragraph or a specific title on your page so that once you press on it it will take you to where the linked part is.

Syntax: all you have to do is simply you give the specified part an id and then call that id name using the id selector in the link part inside of the anchor specified in the previous points.

## Note: Lists can be nested, which means that you can actually put a list inside another list.

# CSS part:
Basically CSS acts as a container or a box for the HTML elements therefore every element inside of it has dimensions that need to be set apprpriatley through some properties to make the web page more presentable.

To set the prperties of the page we need specific attributes such as :

1- Dimensions: Width & Height, so you can set dimensions it has a wide variety of measurments that you can control the way you please, also you can limit them by choosing the min and max attributes that are specified for both.

2- Overflowing content: Which is used specifically if the content inside is larger than the "BOX" to set it properly and it also has it's own attributes you can use:
   
 - Hidden: Used to hide any extra content that does not fitinside the container.

 - Scroll: It adds a scroll bar so the you can scroll up & down ,left & right in the page to see the full content.

 3- Borders: You can set up a border for whatever part of your code you choose. It's good fo designing aand it has its own attributes such as (Width, height, margin, padding, style, color and types of borders).

 4- Margins: sets the outer edges of the border and to creat gaps between containers.

 5- Padding: Sets up the edges of the content inside the border.

 6- Centering content: to put all content in the center of the page to make it more presentable. 

7- Display: It's about how the content will appear to the users.

***Display types:***

- Inline: Displays an element as an inline element.

- Block: Displays an element as a block element.

- Inline-Block: Displays an element as an inline-level block container.

- None: The element is completely removed.

8- Visibility of boxes: They are either hidden or visible.

9- Border images: Allows us to use images as borders of our content.

10- Box shadows: This property attaches one or more shadows to an element.

## That was it for the CSS.

# JavaScript part: 

Today i will be summarizing what i have learned about arrays in JS.

An "Array" is a special type of variables that allows you to store a set of related values inside of it so you can operate easily on them later on.
