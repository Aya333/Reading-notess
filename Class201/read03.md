## My summary of the reading of this class.
# The HTML part:
Reading this part about HTML **list's** i have learned that we need list's in our website's for various reasons therefore there are different types of list's.

1-**Unordered lists**: Which are un-numbered list and it has bullet points instead of numbers.

And its Syntax:(you basically write "ul" inside the tag and then you use "li".<em> Note that the items are defined inside of the ul tag </em>)

2-**Ordered lists**: They are lists that are numbered and always in order.
Syntax: (Write "ol" inside its tag and the define the items between starting and ending tags of the list)

3-**Definition lists**: Are basically lists that define specific terms and each item of it is a definition.

The definition list has its own types of lists:

- DL: Used to define a set of terms all together.

- DT: Used to define a term.

- DD: Used to give one or more definition of the same term.

## Note: Lists can be nested, which means that you can actually put a list inside another list.

# CSS part:
Basically CSS acts as a container or a box for the HTML elements therefore every element inside of it has dimensions that need to be set apprpriatley through some properties to make the web page more presentable.

To set the prperties of the page we need specific attributes such as :

1- Dimensions: Width & Height, so you can set dimensions it has a wide variety of measurments that you can control the way you please, also you can limit them by choosing the min and max attributes that are specified for both.

2- Overflowing content: Which is used specifically if the content inside is larger than the "BOX" to set it properly and it also has it's own attributes you can use:
   
 - Hidden: Used to hide any extra content that does not fitinside the container.

 - Scroll: It adds a scroll bar so the you can scroll up & down ,left & right in the page to see the full content.

 3- Borders: You can set up a border for whatever part of your code you choose. It's good fo designing aand it has its own attributes such as (Width, height, margin, padding, style, color and types of borders).

 4- Margins: sets the outer edges of the border and to creat gaps between containers.

 5- Padding: Sets up the edges of the content inside the border.

 6- Centering content: to put all content in the center of the page to make it more presentable. 

7- Display: It's about how the content will appear to the users.

***Display types:***

- Inline: Displays an element as an inline element.

- Block: Displays an element as a block element.

- Inline-Block: Displays an element as an inline-level block container.

- None: The element is completely removed.

8- Visibility of boxes: They are either hidden or visible.

9- Border images: Allows us to use images as borders of our content.

10- Box shadows: This property attaches one or more shadows to an element.

## That was it for the CSS.

# JavaScript part: 

Today i will be summarizing what i have learned about arrays in JS.

An "Array" is a special type of variables that allows you to store a set of related values inside of it so you can operate easily on them later on.
