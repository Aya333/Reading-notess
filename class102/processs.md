# My summary on reading Duckett’s HTML & CSS book:
What I have learned reading chapter 18 called process & design is that there are a few things you need to take in consideration before starting the work on your web site.
So first of all, when talking to your client the very first thing you need to know is **who the targeted audience is?** Because that’s who you will be designing and building the website for that should be your main focus.
The book suggests a few questions to help you understand further (read the book it’s helpful) it also mentions a great method you can follow which is by creating fictional visitors for your website where you can test different thongs on.
Second thing to consider after knowing which groups of people you are targeting is **why they would choose to visit your website out of all others?** And for this the book suggests two main key points that would help: 

1.	**Visitors motivation**: What does your website provide that others don’t in other words will it be helpful in any means or a total time waster?
2.	**Visitors goals**: What will the audience be visiting your website for? Is it for a general information, research or to buy a product? 
3.	You’ll also need to know **how often people will be visiting your website** so can be able to keep tracking and updating it.
It is very important for a developer two consider such things as it will be beneficial for both him and his client.
The third thing you can do is make a **site map** which is basically a diagram you can categorize your web pages through it would provide you with an overview of your whole project which can in return help you group individual information’s that relate to one another together into individual categories.

The fourth thing is making a **wire frame**; which is almost a “Sketch” to your website to help you know which element goes where and on what side/page or as i would think of it as a pre layout to your website.

## All of the previous point’s relate to the process of creating a website and now for the design part a few things to take in consideration starting with:
Understanding that your design is not just a layout of different paragraphs, graphics, pictures and colors, it is much more than that it’s the main gate to which through it people will decide to ever come back to your website or it will be a one time thing for them, it’s literally the message you are trying to get it out to them and therefore it will help them get an almost immediate idea about the content of the page.
So, for that three major things you need to consider:
1.	**Content**: The content is the first thing you need to think about and especially the contents and design  of home page as it would be your way of communicating with the users and it would give them a great idea about the website plus it’s content and you definitely do not want to give them  any wrong ideas.
2.	**Prioritizing**: By this we mean prioritizing information what information should appear in the beginning…etc. Because you would want something that would stick out to them and keep them interested in learning more so, for these developers use something called visual hierarchy and it’s basically the arrangement of a pages components in order of their importance so it would be very easy for users to understand and use.
3.	**Organization**: Which as we mentioned previously is about categorizing and grouping similar and related components together for example you can use the same color story to specify one category or a specific information and anything related to it.
Remember this is just a summary it’s short and straight to the point so if you are looking for deeper and more information, I would suggest you to read the book.
