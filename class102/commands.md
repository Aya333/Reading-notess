# Commands used in the terminal:
The command line also known as terminal in used to run commands on your machine it doesn’t exclude GUI’s usage but you can work on them side by side and you can view it as if it adds up to the work of the GUI.
- What is a terminal?
It is users interface that is based on text, as you write commands to run operations on your computer.
-How to open it on different systems?
•	Mac: Go to Applications -> utilities -> terminal or you can use a shortcut from your keyboard just press ‘’Command button + Space bar’’
•	Linux: Go to Application-> system/utilities -> Terminal or press ‘’right click’’ on your desktop it may give you the option ‘Open in terminal’.
•	Windows: Here you will have to remotely log from a remote machine or download WSL and one of Linux’s distributions to use it.
Now in the terminal there is something called shell and it determines how the operating system will behave and there are many types of shells available most common one used is bash or you can type the word ‘echo’ to let you know the current shell in use.[1]

-Important commands to know:
1.	PWD: It stands for print working directory which basically gives you the name of the current directory that you are working on.
2.	LS: It’s a shortcut of the word list and it gives you a list of all files existing in the current directory.
3.	CD: It stands for change directory and it’s used to move around between directories.
4.	Paths: Every file/directory has a path which helps you keeping track of your current file location and we have two types of paths:
•	Relative path: In this path we specify the location of the file or directory with where we are currently in the system.
•	Absolute path: In this path root directory is very easy to notice because it starts with a forward slash and each sub directory is separated by forward slash. 
      To build paths in various ways:
•	~ (tilde): Refers to the main directory that contains the directory you want to open.
•	. (dot): Refers to the current directory you are on.
•	.. (double dots): Refers to the parent directory.[2]
-Important notes:
1.	In Linux everything is treated as a file therefore every file has an extension, well unlike windows Linux ignores extensions as it looks inside the file to determine its type.
2.	Linux is case sensitive and therefore you must be aware especially when writing commands as the simple letter can mean two different things in this case.
3.	You must be aware of spaces in files space because in Linux a space can be viewed as another command and in this case it can be resolved in two ways; you either put the file name between single quotes or use back slash instead of space, both methods are correct.
4.	If you would like to show in terminal a hidden file use the command ‘’ls-a” as ‘’ls’’ on its own does not display hidden files, also in Linux you can hide a file by simply start its name with a full stop.[3]
