Growth mindset is an **adaptive** method that you can apply and master if you practice it as often as you can, it’s a lifestyle it’s definitely not what most people think that it’s inherited through genetics  or people are simply born this way, well that’s not false but it doesn’t mean that we cannot challenge and work hard on developing our lives in order to get to this point in life, it will take time absolutely just like everything else we would like to master but the key point is that it’s not impossible. 
How do I keep myself in growth mindset?
1.	*I try my best to monitor my behaviors and thoughts throughout the day and every time I notice myself going back to my old behavior’s I just shift my thoughts into the growth mindset and the goal’s I’m trying to achieve.*
2.	*Whenever I face an obstacle I try to view it as a challenge and apply new ways to solve also always try to different learning strategies.*
3.	*I also remind myself of how great it would feel when I get the desired outcome.*
