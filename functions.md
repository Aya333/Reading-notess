### A summary of Ducketts book:
## Functions
Every function in JavaScript is a Function object. See Function for information on properties and methods of Function objects.

To return a value other than the default, a function must have a return statement that specifies the value to return. A function without a return statement will return a default value. In the case of a constructor called with the new keyword, the default value is the value of its this parameter. For all other functions, the default return value is undefined.

1-
Declaration of a function:
Basically creates the function so we can call it later on in the code.
**Syntax:**function name([param[, param[, ... param]]]) {
   statements
}
where:
- **Name**
The function name.
- **Param**
The name of an argument to be passed to the function.
- **Statements**
The statements comprising the body of the function.
We call functions by mentioning it's name with the parameters only if they are declared inside of it.

2-Function expression: JavaScript allows us to assign a function to a variable and then use that variable as a function. It is called function expression.

3-Anonymous functions: JavaScript allows us to define a function without any name. This unnamed function is called anonymous function. Anonymous function must be assigned to a variable.

### As i hav mentioned a lot previously this is only my summary and what i have understood from reading the book and taking lectures.
