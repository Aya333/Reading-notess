# A summary of Ducketts book:
## CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web page, for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.

##Properties of CSS:

1-A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.
 Selectors i used in this course:
 -Class selector: Selects all elements that have the given class attribute.
Syntax: .classname
-Type selector: Selects all elements that have the given node name.
Syntax: elementname(tag name)
- ID selector: Selects an element based on the value of its id attribute. There should be only one element with a given ID in a document.
Syntax: #idname
-Universal selector: Selects all elements. Optionally, it may be restricted to a specific namespace or to all namespaces.
Syntax: * ns|* *|*
## Now im gonna mention a few properties of CSS:
-align-content
-align-items 
-border
-font
-outline
-background
-display
And much more.

## Colors (Chapter 11):
The colorCSS data type represents a color in the sRGB color space. A color may also include an alpha-channel transparency value, indicating how the color should composite with its background.

A color can be defined in any of the following ways:

Using a keyword (such as blue or transparent)
Using the RGB cubic-coordinate system (via the #-hexadecimal or the rgb() and rgba() functional notations)
Using the HSL cylindrical-coordinate system (via the hsl() and hsla() functional notations).

### As i hav mentioned a lot previously this is only my summary and what i have understood from reading the book and taking lectures.
